how to install fltk:

The gui applications require fltk with API version 1.3
Tested with fltk version 1.3.2
Be aware fltk 1.3.2 has a bug that causes 'fltk-cofig --version' to erroneously display version 1.3.1

Install fltk with yum isntall fltk-devel
or build fltk from source:
	download tarball from fltk.org
	unzip and cd into folder
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
