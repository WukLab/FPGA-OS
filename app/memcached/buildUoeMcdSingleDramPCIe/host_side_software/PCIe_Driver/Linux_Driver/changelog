changes to appnote 1022:

Because Fedora has deprecated and changed some functions since this driver was released, 2 small changes were necessary:
in XPCIe_init(void):
replace pci_find_device by pci_get_device

in struct file_operations XPCIe_Intf

replace ioctl by unlocked_ioctl


adjusted signature of xpcie_ioctl to conform to unlocked_ioctl

inserted functionality to read and write registers
added a header to define a data structure that can be exchanged for ioctl
