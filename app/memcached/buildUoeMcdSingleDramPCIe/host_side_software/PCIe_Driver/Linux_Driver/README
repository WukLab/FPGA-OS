README: XPCIE Sample  Device Driver FC10 tested
-----------------------------------------

Manifest:

1. README: This file.
2. xpcie.c : XPCIE device driver.
--met.cpp not here any more
--3. met.cpp : Example memory endpoint test.    moved to folder Test_PCIE
4. make_device : Script that creates the xpcie device on the system. 
   Must be run before loading the device driver.
5. Makefile : Makefile 
   a. Compiles xpcie.c into a loadable xpcie.ko.
   --b. Compiles met.cpp into met executable



To make, install and load the driver and run memory test (met).
>vi xpcie.c :change to match the DID of the target board in the system.
>make
>./make_device
>insmod xpcie.ko
>./met

to do all of the above in one go, run install_driver.sh


Board must be powered on and hardware design loaded BEFORE host system is booted
check presence of pcie card with lspci    (should show up as "Memory controller: Xilinx Corporation Zomojo Z1") 
install driver
run some tests


nuxNote:
	lspci shows the pci cards in the system
	lsmod shows the loaded devices
	rmmod xpcie removes driver, insmod inserts driver
