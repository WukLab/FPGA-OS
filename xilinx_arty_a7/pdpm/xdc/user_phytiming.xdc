## If the interface timing constraints cannot be met then these can be relaxed by adjusting the values in this
## xdc file which is set to be processed after all other xdc files
## this also allows for the IODELAY tap delay setting to be adjusted without needing to modify the xdc's
## provided with the core
## All commands in this file can be used directly in the tcl command window if the synthesized or implemented design is open.
